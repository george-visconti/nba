- This project uses the NBA API to get the statistic leaders of the five main categories for the 2020-2021 NBA season. From there we clean the data and write it to an endpoint (https://nba-stat-leaders-endpoint.herokuapp.com/) using flask

- We created a react app (https://nba-stat-leaders.herokuapp.com/) that would fetch the data from the endpoint and display the information.

- Anticipated future development: Instead of displaying the statistic leaders from the 2020-2021 season we will display the current NBA season stat leaders, which may change daily or weekly during the season.
