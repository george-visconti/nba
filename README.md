Backstory: As a college basketball player who has invested ample time into the game and an advid NBA fan I thought it would be interesting to do a personal project that incorporates this passion of mine. The goal of this project is to use the NBA API to get the statistic leaders of points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals per game and write this data to an endpoint using Flask. From there I will use React to fetch the data from the endpoint and create a web application to display the information. 

What has been done so far:
  - Created a text file for the required dependencies of the project
  - Created a class to organize the player data
  - Created a simple flask application to use the NBA API to get the stat leaders of the 5 major categories
  - The flask app writes the leaders to an endpoint in json format
